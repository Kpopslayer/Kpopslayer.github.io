				<h2 class="Victoria">Victoria Frances</h2>
				<p>Frances and her popular style are inspired by the Gothic movement, and her work is considered a model to follow in terms of illustration 
				within this genre: ghostly women wearing long dresses with vampirical attributes. Her illustrations tend to depict solitary characters,
				young women or couples in a romantic or melancholic atmosphere. She is influenced by a number of writers including Edgar Allan Poe,
				Anne Rice, Goethe, Baudelaire, Bram Stoker, as well as illustrators such as Brian Froud, Arthur Rackham, Edmund Dulac or Luis Royo 
				and bands like Dark Sanctuary, whom she worked with in 2009.</p>
				<h2>Luis Royo</h2>
				<p>Beginning his career as a furniture designer, he was attracted to the comics industry in the late 1970s by the work of artists like Enki Bilal and Moebius,
				and in 1979 he turned to art as a full-time career.Within a few years, he was publishing art within and on the covers 
				of such magazines as Comix Rambla Internacional, El Vibora, Heavy Metal, National Lampoon and Comic Art as well as providing 
				cover illustrations for several American publishers.</p>
